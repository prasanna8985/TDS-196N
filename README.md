# TDS-194N
 Section 194N of the Income Tax Act in India mandates Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on cash withdrawals exceeding specified limits to promote digital transactions and curb black money. Here's a simplified overview:

- **Applicability**: TDS applies to cash withdrawals from banks, cooperative societies engaged in banking, and post offices. It affects individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), companies, partnerships, and other entities. Certain entities, like government bodies and banking companies, are exempt. 

- **Threshold Limits and TDS Rates**:
  - **For Individuals Who Have Filed Income Tax Returns (ITRs) in Any of the Last Three Assessment Years**:
    - Withdrawals up to ₹1 crore in a financial year: No TDS.
    - Withdrawals exceeding ₹1 crore: TDS at 2% on the amount over ₹1 crore. 
  - **For Individuals Who Have Not Filed ITRs in the Last Three Assessment Years**:
    - Withdrawals up to ₹20 lakh: No TDS.
    - Withdrawals between ₹20 lakh and ₹1 crore: TDS at 2% on the amount over ₹20 lakh.
    - Withdrawals exceeding ₹1 crore: TDS at 5% on the amount over ₹1 crore. 

Calculation: The threshold limit is calculated per bank or post office account, not per individual. For example, if you have accounts in multiple banks, each account has its own threshold. 

  Objective: This section aims to discourage large cash transactions and encourage digital payments, thereby reducing the circulation of unaccounted money. 

Exceptions: Certain recipients, such as government bodies, banks, cooperative societies, and others notified by the government, are exempt from TDS under this section. 

It's important to note that these provisions are designed to promote transparency and accountability in financial transactions. For detailed information, refer to the official Income Tax Department resources or consult a tax professional.
